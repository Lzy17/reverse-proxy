# Tests

## Note to user:
This repo contains batch scripts that are not guaranteed to work and are intended for development only. Use them at your own risk :)

Scripts and their rationale

`basic_notebook.sh` starts a basic notebook

`basic_jupyterlab.sh` starts a basic jupyterlab server

`assumeport.sh` assumes the port is 8888

`batch_singularity.sh` is for future development with singularity
